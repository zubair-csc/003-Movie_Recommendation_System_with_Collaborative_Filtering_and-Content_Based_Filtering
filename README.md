🧠 Movie Recommendation System with Collaborative & Content-Based Filtering  
================================================================================

📋 **Project Overview**  
This project implements a hybrid movie recommendation system using both **content-based filtering** (via TF-IDF similarity on movie metadata) and **collaborative filtering** (using matrix factorization via SVD). It demonstrates a full pipeline, including data loading from the MovieLens dataset, model building, evaluation using RMSE & MAE, and personalized movie recommendations.

---

🎯 **Objectives**

- Recommend movies based on user preferences and movie content  
- Implement and compare two distinct recommendation strategies  
- Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics  
- Enable dynamic predictions using collaborative filtering  
- Visualize similarity, predictions, and results for better interpretation

---

📊 **Dataset Information**  
**Dataset**: [MovieLens Latest Small Dataset (100k ratings)](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)  
**Size**: 10,000+ ratings, ~9,000 movies  
**Files Used**:  
- `movies.csv` – movie metadata including title and genres  
- `ratings.csv` – user ratings (userId, movieId, rating)

**Target Output**: Recommended Movies (Top-N)  
**Filtering Techniques**:
- Content-Based: Based on TF-IDF of genres and titles
- Collaborative: Based on user-movie rating matrix using SVD

---

🔧 **Technical Implementation**

📌 **Recommendation Algorithms**:
- **Content-Based Filtering** using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- **Collaborative Filtering** using Surprise’s SVD (Matrix Factorization)

🧹 **Preprocessing**:
- TF-IDF Vectorization of movie genres + titles
- Mapping of userId ↔ movieId interactions
- Construction of similarity matrix for fast lookups

⚙️ **Modeling**:
- Train/test split (implicit in collaborative filtering)
- 3-Fold Cross Validation for SVD
- Rating prediction for unseen items

📏 **Evaluation Metrics**:
- RMSE, MAE for collaborative filtering
- Not applicable for content-based (unsupervised)

📊 **Visualizations** (recommended for extension):
- Cosine similarity heatmap
- Top-N recommended movies per user
- RMSE/MAE plot across folds (for advanced use)

🚀 **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zubair-csc/003-Movie_Recommendation_System_with_Collaborative_Filtering_and-Content_Based_Filtering.git
cd 003-Movie_Recommendation_System_with_Collaborative_Filtering_and-Content_Based_Filtering
````

Install required packages (if running locally):

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn scikit-surprise
```

Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb
```

Or upload to Google Colab for interactive use.

📋 **Requirements**

```txt
numpy>=1.24.0
pandas>=1.3.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
scikit-surprise>=1.1.1
```

📈 **Results**

| Model               | Metric     | Score (approx.) |
| ------------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| Collaborative (SVD) | RMSE       | \~0.85          |
| Collaborative (SVD) | MAE        | \~0.67          |
| Content-Based       | Similarity | Cosine TF-IDF   |

🎬 **Examples**:

* Content-based recommendations for `Toy Story (1995)`
* Collaborative filtering top-5 movies for User ID 1

---

🔍 **Key Insights**

* Collaborative filtering offers personalized results but requires historical data
* Content-based filtering works even for new users (cold start)
* Combined approaches can deliver broader coverage and higher relevance

---

📚 **Learning Outcomes**

* Build hybrid recommender systems using Python
* Leverage TF-IDF and cosine similarity for content-based filtering
* Apply matrix factorization (SVD) for collaborative filtering
* Evaluate recommendation quality using industry-standard metrics
* Use MovieLens dataset for experimentation and benchmarking
